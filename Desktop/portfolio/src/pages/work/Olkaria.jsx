          caption="Olkaria lies within the Great Rift Valley, a tectonically active region of exceptional biodiversity. Within it, Hell’s Gate National Park was established in 1984 as a protected habitat for migratory birds and wildlife. Despite its conservation status, geothermal extraction near and within the park has transformed the area into an industrial energy zone, causing habitat fragmentation, displacement of Indigenous communities, and loss of significant landscapes.

Although KenGen operates the majority of Kenya’s power plants and is responsible for environmental mitigation, meaningful remediation has remained limited since geothermal development began."

Vegetation clearance for geothermal pipelines has displaced Indigenous pastoral communities, including the Maasai, while geothermal brine pollution has contaminated Lake Naivasha, Olkaria’s primary freshwater source. Industrial partnerships—such as the Oserian Flower Farm’s reliance on geothermal steam for large-scale rose production—have tied local land to extractive energy systems. With the Great Rift Valley holding an estimated 10,000 MW of geothermal potential, the Olkaria Geothermal Power Plant alone targets one-fifth of this capacity. Backed by international financiers, KenGen continues expansion despite the region’s environmental fragility.              </div>

                  on a scalar level; local, regional,  ational, and global, we started to have conversations about our design 
                  and how it could impact these different scales, especially as the potential for geothermal energy expands. 
                  After much consideration, we decided to intervene at the major source of the problem, the geothermal steam.

Since geothermal potential was identified in the 1950s, more than 300 wells have been drilled in and around Hell’s Gate National Park. Many wells remain vented for monitoring, releasing steam containing hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and trace heavy metals that pose risks to wildlife and nearby communities. Residents of Olkaria and workers employed by KenGen report respiratory illnesses linked to air exposure, while continuous high-decibel noise from the wells disrupts animal habitats and migratory patterns.

                  Altogether, noise, air pollution and habitat fragmentation are decreasing or completely wiping out a number of important animal species at the park, 
                  including the birds and vultures that are extremely sensitive to noise and vibration, and other animals that hunt by sound. 
                  To target the challenges caused by these, we’re going to place our intervention in two different parts: one at the wellhead, and then the other four along the pipe.. 
                  To target the challenges caused by these, we’re going to place our intervention in two different parts: one at the wellhead, and then the other four along the pipe.
                  The permanent wellhead silencer + water filter will mitigate the noise created by the wellheads and will filter the steam and condense it to potable water. 
                  It will reduce the range of air and noise pollution that were eradicating the birds, vultures, and land animal species that hunt by sound.
                  This would then widen the extent of undisturbed environments. And then the individual trains can provide a space of safe cohabitation for the agents affected by the development.
                  Allowing them physical corridors to freely travel through the site.

                  To combat habitat fragmentation and promote environmental justice, our design is strategically devised to live and move upon the existing and future expansions of the geothermal pipes,  harnessing the energy that will be used to benefit the local ecosystems of Hell’s Gate National Park.
The section shows the inside secrets of the geothermal steam hacking system and how our intervention is situated in the vast landscape of Olkaria. The existing geothermal pipes that are strategically carrying steam waste are drilled with holes at regular intervals where a valve is placed that connect 
and disconnect to the structure disconnect on demand, clipping into receiving pipes in the trains floor plates for easy access.
Each design cart is chained together to form a longer system of continuous steam hacking programs such as steam kitchen and portable water station.  
It leaves traces of life as it leaves water flash and fall-over plants along where it moves. It will also disperse living trash from the steam kitchen and bird sanctuary into the near surroundings, creating a map of liveliness and recombination.

                    The greenhouse strategically hacks the steam to 
                    remain set at a temperature of 82 degrees Fahrenheit, ensuring the local crops, such as baby corn, pak choi, 
                    courgettes, and more are ready to be eaten during the gathering ceremony for the local Maasai Tribe. 
                    Ruppell’s vultures know this time of day as they await in the bird sanctuary for their scraps they will receive from composted meals from the community.

                    After nourishing themselves, local community members plan to travel down the landscape to depart back to their homes, 
                    where they observe the vast Olkaria landscapes, interacting with local fauna who are feeding off of the facade.

                    to ensure the environment and its ecosystems are well nourished, looking forward to interacting with 
                    these interventions the very next day.”
